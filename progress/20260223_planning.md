**Previous Report:** None (first session)
**Phase:** 1A (Now–mid-Mar)

## Status
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Project scaffold | ✅ Complete | Directory structure, CLAUDE.md, README.md |
| Session commands (handoff/catchup) | ✅ Complete | Adapted from research-project templates to ML learning project |
| Session plan | ✅ Complete | 15-session plan with readings in docs/SESSION_PLAN.md |
| Locked-in decisions | ✅ Complete | Dataset, DLRM, W&B, e5-base-v2 — recorded in CLAUDE.md |
| Data pipeline | 🔜 Next | Session 2 |

## What Was Built
- Modified `commands/handoff.md` — replaced research-project protocol (HPC, PI feedback, hypotheses) with ML learning protocol (roadmap checks, PyTorch patterns, design decisions, Meta team connections)
- Modified `commands/catchup.md` — reframed for ML learning project with guided-build awareness
- Created `docs/SESSION_PLAN.md` — full 15-session build plan with pre/post readings per session
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` — locked in tech stack choices, added "Locked-In Decisions" section
- Created `learning/` directory structure for cross-session learning persistence

Agent wrote all of the above (planning/scaffold — low learning value per CLAUDE.md conventions).

## Key Learnings
Planning session — no PyTorch code written. Key decisions made:
- Amazon Electronics as dataset (large enough, has text for LLM cold-start, natural long-tail)
- DLRM over DCN-v2 (Meta's own architecture, worth learning the math deeply)
- W&B over TensorBoard (teaches production logging discipline)
- e5-base-v2 over MiniLM (better quality, 768-dim, negligible extra cost for inference-only)

## Remaining Work / Next Steps
1. **Session 2: Data pipeline** — download Amazon Electronics, build Dataset/DataLoader, negative sampling
2. Pre-reading assigned: PyTorch Data Loading tutorial, Amazon Reviews dataset format
3. First user-written code will be in Session 2 (Dataset class, collate_fn, negative sampling)

## Files to Read First
- `CLAUDE.md` — all conventions and locked-in decisions
- `docs/SESSION_PLAN.md` — full session plan with readings
- `commands/handoff.md` — updated handoff protocol
- `commands/catchup.md` — updated catchup protocol
